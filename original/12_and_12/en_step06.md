Step Six
“Were entirely ready to have God remove all
these defects of character.”

“THIS is the Step that separates the men from the boys.”
So declares a well-loved clergyman who happens to be one
of A.A.’s greatest friends. He goes on to explain that any
person capable of enough willingness and honesty to try repeatedly Step Six on all his faults—without any reservations
whatever—has indeed come a long way spiritually, and is
therefore entitled to be called a man who is sincerely trying
to grow in the image and likeness of his own Creator.
Of course, the often disputed question of whether God
can—and will, under certain conditions—remove defects
of character will be answered with a prompt affirmative by
almost any A.A. member. To him, this proposition will be
no theory at all; it will be just about the largest fact in his
life. He will usually offer his proof in a statement like this:
“Sure, I was beaten, absolutely licked. My own willpower just wouldn’t work on alcohol. Change of scene, the
best efforts of family, friends, doctors, and clergymen got
no place with my alcoholism. I simply couldn’t stop drinking, and no human being could seem to do the job for me.
But when I became willing to clean house and then asked
a Higher Power, God as I understood Him, to give me release, my obsession to drink vanished. It was lifted right
out of me.”

STEP SIX

In A.A. meetings all over the world, statements just like
this are heard daily. It is plain for everybody to see that each
sober A.A. member has been granted a release from this
very obstinate and potentially fatal obsession. So in a very
complete and literal way, all A.A.’s have “become entirely
ready” to have God remove the mania for alcohol from their
lives. And God has proceeded to do exactly that.
Having been granted a perfect release from alcoholism,
why then shouldn’t we be able to achieve by the same means
a perfect release from every other difficulty or defect? This
is a riddle of our existence, the full answer to which may
be only in the mind of God. Nevertheless, at least a part of
the answer to it is apparent to us.
When men and women pour so much alcohol into themselves that they destroy their lives, they commit a most unnatural act. Defying their instinctive desire for self-preservation, they seem bent upon self-destruction. They work
against their own deepest instinct. As they are humbled
by the terrific beating administered by alcohol, the grace
of God can enter them and expel their obsession. Here
their powerful instinct to live can cooperate fully with their
Creator’s desire to give them new life. For nature and God
alike abhor suicide.
But most of our other difficulties don’t fall under such
a category at all. Every normal person wants, for example,
to eat, to reproduce, to be somebody in the society of his
fellows. And he wishes to be reasonably safe and secure as
he tries to attain these things. Indeed, God made him that
way. He did not design man to destroy himself by alcohol,
but He did give man instincts to help him to stay alive.

It is nowhere evident, at least in this life, that our Creator expects us fully to eliminate our instinctual drives. So
far as we know, it is nowhere on the record that God has
completely removed from any human being all his natural
drives.
Since most of us are born with an abundance of natural
desires, it isn’t strange that we often let these far exceed
their intended purpose. When they drive us blindly, or we
willfully demand that they supply us with more satisfactions or pleasures than are possible or due us, that is the
point at which we depart from the degree of perfection that
God wishes for us here on earth. That is the measure of
our character defects, or, if you wish, of our sins.
If we ask, God will certainly forgive our derelictions.
But in no case does He render us white as snow and keep
us that way without our cooperation. That is something we
are supposed to be willing to work toward ourselves. He
asks only that we try as best we know how to make progress in the building of character.
So Step Six—“Were entirely ready to have God remove
all these defects of character”—is A.A.’s way of stating
the best possible attitude one can take in order to make a
beginning on this lifetime job. This does not mean that we
expect all our character defects to be lifted out of us as the
drive to drink was. A few of them may be, but with most of
them we shall have to be content with patient improvement.
The key words “entirely ready” underline the fact that we
want to aim at the very best we know or can learn.
How many of us have this degree of readiness? In an absolute sense practically nobody has it. The best we can do,

66

STEP SIX

with all the honesty that we can summon, is to try to have
it. Even then the best of us will discover to our dismay that
there is always a sticking point, a point at which we say,
“No, I can’t give this up yet.” And we shall often tread on
even more dangerous ground when we cry, “This I will never give up!” Such is the power of our instincts to overreach
themselves. No matter how far we have progressed, desires
will always be found which oppose the grace of God.
Some who feel they have done well may dispute this, so
let’s try to think it through a little further. Practically everybody wishes to be rid of his most glaring and destructive
handicaps. No one wants to be so proud that he is scorned
as a braggart, nor so greedy that he is labeled a thief. No
one wants to be angry enough to murder, lustful enough to
rape, gluttonous enough to ruin his health. No one wants
to be agonized by the chronic pain of envy or to be paralyzed by sloth. Of course, most human beings don’t suffer
these defects at these rock-bottom levels.
We who have escaped these extremes are apt to congratulate ourselves. Yet can we? After all, hasn’t it been selfinterest, pure and simple, that has enabled most of us to
escape? Not much spiritual effort is involved in avoiding
excesses which will bring us punishment anyway. But when
we face up to the less violent aspects of these very same
defects, then where do we stand?
What we must recognize now is that we exult in some of
our defects. We really love them. Who, for example, doesn’t
like to feel just a little superior to the next fellow, or even
quite a lot superior? Isn’t it true that we like to let greed
masquerade as ambition? To think of liking lust seems im-

STEP SIX

67

possible. But how many men and women speak love with
their lips, and believe what they say, so that they can hide
lust in a dark corner of their minds? And even while staying within conventional bounds, many people have to admit that their imaginary sex excursions are apt to be all
dressed up as dreams of romance.
Self-righteous anger also can be very enjoyable. In a
perverse way we can actually take satisfaction from the
fact that many people annoy us, for it brings a comfortable
feeling of superiority. Gossip barbed with our anger, a
polite form of murder by character assassination, has its
satisfactions for us, too. Here we are not trying to help
those we criticize; we are trying to proclaim our own righteousness.
When gluttony is less than ruinous, we have a milder
word for that, too; we call it “taking our comfort.” We live
in a world riddled with envy. To a greater or less degree, everybody is infected with it. From this defect we must surely
get a warped yet definite satisfaction. Else why would we
consume such great amounts of time wishing for what we
have not, rather than working for it, or angrily looking for
attributes we shall never have, instead of adjusting to the
fact, and accepting it? And how often we work hard with
no better motive than to be secure and slothful later on—
only we call that “retiring.” Consider, too, our talents for
procrastination, which is really sloth in five syllables. Nearly anyone could submit a good list of such defects as these,
and few of us would seriously think of giving them up, at
least until they cause us excessive misery.
Some people, of course, may conclude that they are in-

68

STEP SIX

deed ready to have all such defects taken from them. But
even these people, if they construct a list of still milder
defects, will be obliged to admit that they prefer to hang
on to some of them. Therefore, it seems plain that few of
us can quickly or easily become ready to aim at spiritual
and moral perfection; we want to settle for only as much
perfection as will get us by in life, according, of course, to
our various and sundry ideas of what will get us by. So the
difference between “the boys and the men” is the difference
between striving for a self-determined objective and for the
perfect objective which is of God.
Many will at once ask, “How can we accept the entire
implication of Step Six? Why—that is perfection!” This
sounds like a hard question, but practically speaking, it
isn’t. Only Step One, where we made the 100 percent admission we were powerless over alcohol, can be practiced
with absolute perfection. The remaining eleven Steps state
perfect ideals. They are goals toward which we look, and
the measuring sticks by which we estimate our progress.
Seen in this light, Step Six is still difficult, but not at all
impossible. The only urgent thing is that we make a beginning, and keep trying.
If we would gain any real advantage in the use of this
Step on problems other than alcohol, we shall need to make
a brand new venture into open-mindedness. We shall need
to raise our eyes toward perfection, and be ready to walk in
that direction. It will seldom matter how haltingly we walk.
The only question will be “Are we ready?”
Looking again at those defects we are still unwilling to
give up, we ought to erase the hard-and-fast lines that we

STEP SIX

69

have drawn. Perhaps we shall be obliged in some cases still
to say, “This I cannot give up yet…,” but we should not say
to ourselves, “This I will never give up!”
Let’s dispose of what appears to be a hazardous open
end we have left. It is suggested that we ought to become
entirely willing to aim toward perfection. We note that
some delay, however, might be pardoned. That word, in the
mind of a rationalizing alcoholic, could certainly be given
a long-term meaning. He could say, “How very easy! Sure,
I’ll head toward perfection, but I’m certainly not going to
hurry any. Maybe I can postpone dealing with some of my
problems indefinitely.” Of course, this won’t do. Such a
bluffing of oneself will have to go the way of many another
pleasant rationalization. At the very least, we shall have to
come to grips with some of our worst character defects and
take action toward their removal as quickly as we can.
The moment we say, “No, never!” our minds close against
the grace of God. Delay is dangerous, and rebellion may be
fatal. This is the exact point at which we abandon limited
objectives, and move toward God’s will for us.

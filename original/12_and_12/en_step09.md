Step Nine
“Made direct amends to such people wherever
possible, except when to do so would injure them
or others.”

GOOD judgment, a careful sense of timing, courage, and
prudence—these are the qualities we shall need when we
take Step Nine.
After we have made the list of people we have harmed,
have reflected carefully upon each instance, and have tried
to possess ourselves of the right attitude in which to proceed, we will see that the making of direct amends divides
those we should approach into several classes. There will
be those who ought to be dealt with just as soon as we
become reasonably confident that we can maintain our sobriety. There will be those to whom we can make only partial restitution, lest complete disclosures do them or others
more harm than good. There will be other cases where action ought to be deferred, and still others in which by the
very nature of the situation we shall never be able to make
direct personal contact at all.
Most of us begin making certain kinds of direct amends
from the day we join Alcoholics Anonymous. The moment
we tell our families that we are really going to try the program, the process has begun. In this area there are seldom
any questions of timing or caution. We want to come in the
door shouting the good news. After coming from our first
83

STEP NINE

meeting, or perhaps after we have finished reading the book
“Alcoholics Anonymous,” we usually want to sit down with
some member of the family and readily admit the damage
we have done by our drinking. Almost always we want to
go further and admit other defects that have made us hard
to live with. This will be a very different occasion, and in
sharp contrast with those hangover mornings when we alternated between reviling ourselves and blaming the family
(and everyone else) for our troubles. At this first sitting, it
is necessary only that we make a general admission of our
defects. It may be unwise at this stage to rehash certain harrowing episodes. Good judgment will suggest that we ought
to take our time. While we may be quite willing to reveal
the very worst, we must be sure to remember that we cannot
buy our own peace of mind at the expense of others.
Much the same approach will apply at the office or factory. We shall at once think of a few people who know all
about our drinking, and who have been most affected by it.
But even in these cases, we may need to use a little more discretion than we did with the family. We may not want to say
anything for several weeks, or longer. First we will wish to
be reasonably certain that we are on the A.A. beam. Then
we are ready to go to these people, to tell them what A.A.
is, and what we are trying to do. Against this background
we can freely admit the damage we have done and make our
apologies. We can pay, or promise to pay, whatever obligations, financial or otherwise, we owe. The generous response
of most people to such quiet sincerity will often astonish us.
Even our severest and most justified critics will frequently
meet us more than halfway on the first trial.

This atmosphere of approval and praise is apt to be so
exhilarating as to put us off balance by creating an insatiable appetite for more of the same. Or we may be tipped
over in the other direction when, in rare cases, we get a
cool and skeptical reception. This will tempt us to argue,
or to press our point insistently. Or maybe it will tempt us
to discouragement and pessimism. But if we have prepared
ourselves well in advance, such reactions will not deflect us
from our steady and even purpose.
After taking this preliminary trial at making amends, we
may enjoy such a sense of relief that we conclude our task
is finished. We will want to rest on our laurels. The temptation to skip the more humiliating and dreaded meetings
that still remain may be great. We will often manufacture
plausible excuses for dodging these issues entirely. Or we
may just procrastinate, telling ourselves the time is not
yet, when in reality we have already passed up many a fine
chance to right a serious wrong. Let’s not talk prudence
while practicing evasion.
As soon as we begin to feel confident in our new way
of life and have begun, by our behavior and example, to
convince those about us that we are indeed changing for
the better, it is usually safe to talk in complete frankness
with those who have been seriously affected, even those
who may be only a little or not at all aware of what we have
done to them. The only exceptions we will make will be
cases where our disclosure would cause actual harm. These
conversations can begin in a casual or natural way. But if
no such opportunity presents itself, at some point we will
want to summon all our courage, head straight for the per-

86

STEP NINE

son concerned, and lay our cards on the table. We needn’t
wallow in excessive remorse before those we have harmed,
but amends at this level should always be forthright and
generous.
There can only be one consideration which should qualify our desire for a complete disclosure of the damage we
have done. That will arise in the occasional situation where
to make a full revelation would seriously harm the one to
whom we are making amends. Or—quite as important—
other people. We cannot, for example, unload a detailed
account of extramarital adventuring upon the shoulders
of our unsuspecting wife or husband. And even in those
cases where such a matter must be discussed, let’s try to
avoid harming third parties, whoever they may be. It does
not lighten our burden when we recklessly make the crosses
of others heavier.
Many a razor-edged question can arise in other departments of life where this same principle is involved. Suppose, for instance, that we have drunk up a good chunk of
our firm’s money, whether by “borrowing” or on a heavily
padded expense account. Suppose that this may continue
to go undetected, if we say nothing. Do we instantly confess our irregularities to the firm, in the practical certainty
that we will be fired and become unemployable? Are we
going to be so rigidly righteous about making amends that
we don’t care what happens to the family and home? Or do
we first consult those who are to be gravely affected? Do
we lay the matter before our sponsor or spiritual adviser,
earnestly asking God’s help and guidance—meanwhile resolving to do the right thing when it becomes clear, cost

what it may? Of course, there is no pat answer which can
fit all such dilemmas. But all of them do require a complete
willingness to make amends as fast and as far as may be
possible in a given set of conditions.
Above all, we should try to be absolutely sure that we
are not delaying because we are afraid. For the readiness
to take the full consequences of our past acts, and to take
responsibility for the well-being of others at the same time,
is the very spirit of Step Nine.

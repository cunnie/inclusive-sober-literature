# ABOUT THIS REMIX

  This remix by Their Sober Press, aims to make the smallest surgical changes to the original text of _Alcoholics Anonymous_—published and trademarked by A.A. World Services, Inc—in order to make the text inclusive of people of all genders, sexual orientations, and religious beliefs. Our goal was to produce a text that could be read alongside the original (e.g. at a Step Study meeting) with minimal disruption. Care has been taken to ensure the page numbers in this text line up with the page numbers in the original.

  This remix was not authorized or approved by AA World Services, Inc or the A.A. General Service Conference.

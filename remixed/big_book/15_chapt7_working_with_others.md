## WORKING WITH OTHERS

  Practical experience shows that nothing will so much insure immunity from drinking as intensive work with other alcoholics. It works when other activities fail. This is our _twelfth suggestion:_ Carry this message to other alcoholics! You can help when no one else can. You can secure their confidence when others fail. Remember they are very ill.

  Life will take on new meaning. To watch people recover, to see them help others, to watch loneliness vanish, to see a fellowship grow up about you, to have a host of friends—this is an experience you must not miss. We know you will not want to miss it. Frequent contact with newcomers and with each other is the bright spot of our lives.

  Perhaps you are not acquainted with any drinkers who want to recover. You can easily find some by asking a few doctors, ministers, priests or hospitals. They will be only too glad to assist you. Don’t start out as an evangelist or reformer. Unfortunately a lot of prejudice exists. You will be handicapped if you arouse it. Ministers and doctors are competent and you can learn much from them if you wish, but it happens that because of your own drinking experience you can be uniquely useful to other alcoholics. So cooperate; never criticize. To be helpful is our only aim.

  When you discover a prospect for Alcoholics Anonymous, find out all you can about them. If they do not want to stop drinking, don’t waste time trying to persuade them. You may spoil a later opportunity. This advice is given for their family also. They should be patient, realizing they are dealing with a sick person.

  If there is any indication that they want to stop, have a good talk with the person most interested in them—usually their partner. Get an idea of the alcoholics behavior, their problems, their background, the seriousness of their condition, and their religious leanings. You need this information to put yourself in their place, to see how you would like them to approach you if the tables were turned.

  Sometimes it is wise to wait till they go on a binge. The family may object to this, but unless they are in a dangerous physical condition, it is better to risk it. Don’t deal with them when they are very drunk, unless they are ugly and the family needs your help. Wait for the end of the spree, or at least for a lucid interval. Then let their family or a friend ask them if they want to quit for good and if they would go to any extreme to do so. If they say yes, then their attention should be drawn to you as a person who has recovered. You should be described to them as one of a fellowship who, as part of their own recovery, try to help others and who will be glad to talk to them if they care to see you.

  If they do not want to see you, never force yourself upon them. Neither should the family hysterically plead with them to do anything, nor should they tell them much about you. They should wait for the end of their next drinking bout. You might place this book where they can see it in the interval. Here no specific rule can be given. The family must decide these

PAGE 91

things. But urge them not to be over-anxious, for that might spoil matters.

  Usually the family should not try to tell your story. When possible, avoid meeting an alcoholic through their family. Approach through a doctor or an institution is a better bet. If your prospect needs hospitalization, they should have it, but not forcibly unless they are violent. Let the doctor, if they will, tell the alcoholic they have something in the way of a solution.

  When your prospect is better, the doctor might suggest a visit from you. Though you have talked with the family, leave them out of the first discussion. Under these conditions your prospect will see they are under no pressure. They will feel they can deal with you without being nagged by their family. Call on them while they are still jittery. They may be more receptive when depressed.

  See your prospect alone, if possible. At first engage in general conversation. After a while, turn the talk to some phase of drinking. Tell them enough about your drinking habits, symptoms, and experiences to encourage them to speak of themselves. If they wish to talk, let them do so. You will thus get a better idea of how you ought to proceed. If they are not communicative, give them a sketch of your drinking career up to the time you quit. But say nothing, for the moment, of how that was accomplished. If they are in a serious mood dwell on the troubles liquor has caused you, being careful not to moralize or lecture. If their mood is light, tell them humorous stories of your escapades. Get them to tell some of theirs.

  When they see you know all about the drinking game, commence to describe yourself as an alcoholic.

PAGE 92

Tell them how baffled you were, how you finally learned that you were sick. Give them an account of the struggles you made to stop. Show them the mental twist which leads to the first drink of a spree. We suggest you do this as we have done it in the chapter on alcoholism. If they are alcoholic, they will understand you at once. They will match your mental inconsistencies with some of their own.

  If you are satisfied that they a real alcoholic, begin to dwell on the hopeless feature of the malady. Show them, from your own experience, how the distorted mental condition surrounding that first drink prevents normal functioning of the will power. Don’t, at this stage, refer to this book, unless they have seen it and wishes to discuss it. And be careful not to brand them as an alcoholic. Let them draw their own conclusion. If they stick to the idea that they can still control their drinking, tell them that possibly they can—if they are not too alcoholic. But insist that if they are severely afflicted, there may be little chance they can recover by themselves.

  Continue to speak of alcoholism as an illness, a fatal malady. Talk about the conditions of body and mind which accompany it. Keep their attention focussed mainly on your personal experience. Explain that many are doomed who never realize their predicament. Doctors are rightly loath to tell alcoholic patients the whole story unless it will serve some good purpose. But you may talk to them about the hopelessness of alcoholism because you offer a solution. You will soon have your friend admitting they have many, if not all, of the traits of the alcoholic. If their own doctor is willing to tell them that they are alcoholic, so much the better. Even though your protégé may not have en-

PAGE 93

tirely admitted their condition, they have become very curious to know how you got well. Let them ask you that question, if they will. _Tell them exactly what happened to you._ Stress the spiritual feature freely. If they are agnostic or atheist, make it emphatic that _they do not have to agree with your conception of God._ They can choose any conception they like, provided it makes sense to them. _The main thing is that they be willing to believe in a Power greater than themselves that they live by spiritual principles._

  When dealing with such a person, you had better use everyday language to describe spiritual principles. There is no use arousing any prejudice they may have against certain theological terms and conceptions about which they may already be confused. Don’t raise such issues, no matter what your own convictions are.

  Your prospect may belong to a religious denomination. Their religious education and training may be far superior to yours. In that case they are going to wonder how you can add anything to what they already know. But they will be curious to learn why their own convictions have not worked and why yours seem to work so well. They may be an example of the truth that faith alone is insufficient. To be vital, faith must be accompanied by self sacrifice and unselfish, constructive action. Let them see that you are not there to instruct them in religion. Admit that they probably know more about it than you do, but call to their attention the fact that however deep their faith and knowledge, they could not have applied it or they would not drink. Perhaps your story will help them see where they have failed to practice the very precepts they know so well. We represent no

PAGE 94

particular faith or denomination. We are dealing only with general principles common to most denominations.

  Outline the program of action, explaining how you made a self-appraisal, how you straightened out your past and why you are now endeavoring to be helpful to them. It is important for them to realize that your attempt to pass this on to them plays a vital part in your own recovery. Actually, they may be helping you more than you are helping them. Make it plain they are under no obligation to you, that you hope only that they will try to help other alcoholics when they escape their own difficulties. Suggest how important it is that they place the welfare of other people ahead of their own. Make it clear that they are not under pressure, that they needn’t see you again if they don’t want to. You should not be offended if they want to call it off, for they have helped you more than you have helped them. If your talk has been sane, quiet and full of human understanding, you have perhaps made a friend. Maybe you have disturbed them about the question of alcoholism. This is all to the good. The more hopeless they feel, the better. They will be more likely to follow your suggestions.

  Your candidate may give reasons why they need not follow all of the program. They may rebel at the thought of a drastic housecleaning which requires discussion with other people. Do not contradict such views. Tell them you once felt as they do, but you doubt whether you would have made much progress had you not taken action. On your first visit tell them about the Fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous. If they show interest, lend them your copy of this book.

PAGE 95

  Unless your friend wants to talk further about themselves, do not wear out your welcome. Give them a chance to think it over. If you do stay, let them steer the conversation in any direction they like. Sometimes a new prospect is anxious to proceed at once, and you may be tempted to let them do so. This is sometimes a mistake. If they have trouble later, they are likely to say you rushed them. You will be most successful with alcoholics if you do not exhibit any passion for crusade or reform. Never talk down to an alcoholic from any moral or spiritual hilltop; simply lay out the kit of spiritual tools for their inspection. Show them how they worked with you. Offer them friendship and fellowship. Tell them that if they want to get well you will do anything to help.

  If they are not interested in your solution, if they expect you to act only as a banker for their financial difficulties or a nurse for their sprees, you may have to drop them until they change their mind. This they may do after they get hurt some more.

  If they are sincerely interested and wants to see you again, ask them to read this book in the interval. After doing that, they must decide for themselves whether they want to go on. They should not be pushed or prodded by you, their partner, or their friends. If they are to find God, the desire must come from within.
 
  If they think they can do the job in some other way, or prefers some other spiritual approach, encourage them to follow their own conscience. We have no monopoly on God; we merely have an approach that worked with us. But point out that we alcoholics have much in common and that you would like, in any case, to be friendly. Let it go at that.

PAGE 96

  Do not be discouraged if your prospect does not respond at once. Search out another alcoholic and try again. You are sure to find someone desperate enough to accept with eagerness what you offer. We find it a waste of time to keep chasing someone who cannot or will not work with you. If you leave such a person alone, they may soon become convinced that they cannot recover by themselves. To spend too much time on any one situation is to deny some other alcoholic an opportunity to live and be happy. One of our Fellowship failed entirely with their first half dozen prospects. They often says that if they had continued to work on them, they might have deprived many others, who have since recovered, of their chance.

  Suppose now you are making your second visit to an alcoholic. They have read this volume and says they are prepared to go through with the Twelve Steps of the program of recovery. Having had the experience yourself, you can give them much practical advice. Let them know you are available if they wish to make a decision and tell their story, but do not insist upon it if they prefer to consult someone else.

  They may be broke and homeless. If they are, you might try to help them about getting a job, or give them a little financial assistance. But you should not deprive your family or creditors of money they should have. Perhaps you will want to take the alcoholic into your home for a few days. But be sure you use discretion. Be certain they will be welcomed by your family, and that they are not trying to impose upon you for money, connections, or shelter. Permit that and you only harm them. You will be making it possible for them to be insincere.

PAGE 97

You may be aiding in their destruction rather than their recovery.

  Never avoid these responsibilities, but be sure you are doing the right thing if you assume them. Helping others is the foundation stone of your recovery. A kindly act once in a while isn’t enough. You have to act the Good Samaritan every day, if need be. It may mean the loss of many nights’ sleep, great interference with your pleasures, interruptions to your business. It may mean sharing your money and your home, counseling frantic partners and relatives, innumerable trips to police courts, sanitariums, hospitals, jails and asylums. Your telephone may jangle at any time of the day or night. Your partner may sometimes say they are neglected. A drunk may smash the furniture in your home, or burn a mattress. You may have to fight with them if they are violent. Sometimes you will have to call a doctor and administer sedatives under their direction. Another time you may have to send for the police or an ambulance. Occasionally you will have to meet such conditions.

  We seldom allow an alcoholic to live in our homes for long at a time. It is not good for them, and it sometimes creates serious complications in a family.

  Though an alcoholic does not respond, there is no reason why you should neglect their family. You should continue to be friendly to them. The family should be offered your way of life. Should they accept and practice spiritual principles, there is a much better chance that the head of the family will recover. And even though they continue to drink, the family will find life more bearable.

  For the type of alcoholic who is able and willing to

PAGE 98

get well, little charity, in the ordinary sense of the word, is needed or wanted. The people who cry for money and shelter before conquering alcohol, are on the wrong track. Yet we do go to great extremes to provide each other with these very things, when such action is warranted. This may seem inconsistent, but we think it is not.

  It is not the matter of giving that is in question, but when and how to give. That often makes the difference between failure and success. The minute we put our work on a service plane, the alcoholic commences to rely upon our assistance rather than upon God. They clamor for this or that, claiming they cannot master alcohol until their material needs are cared for. Nonsense. Some of us have taken very hard knocks to learn this truth: Job or no job—partner or no partner—we simply do not stop drinking so long as we place dependence upon other people ahead of dependence on God.

  Burn the idea into the consciousness of every person that they can get well regardless of anyone. The only condition is that they trust in God and clean house.

  Now, the domestic problem: There may be divorce, separation, or just strained relations. When your prospect has made such reparation as they can to their family, and has thoroughly explained to them the new principles by which they are living, they should proceed to put those principles into action at home. That is, if they are lucky enough to have a home. Though their family be at fault in many respects, they should not be concerned about that. They should concentrate on their own spiritual demonstration. Argument and fault-finding are to be avoided like the plague. In many homes this is a

PAGE 99

difficult thing to do, but it must be done if any results are to be expected. If persisted in for a few months, the effect on a recovering alcoholic’s family is sure to be great. The most incompatible people discover they have a basis upon which they can meet. Little by little the family may see their own defects and admit them. These can then be discussed in an atmosphere of helpfulness and friendliness.

  After they have seen tangible results, the family will perhaps want to go along. These things will come to pass naturally and in good time provided, however, the alcoholic continues to demonstrate that they can be sober, considerate, and helpful, regardless of what anyone says or does. Of course, we all fall much below this standard many times. But we must try to repair the damage immediately lest we pay the penalty by a spree.

  If there be divorce or separation, there should be no undue haste for the couple to get together. The alcoholic should be sure of their recovery. The partner should fully understand the alcoholic’s new way of life. If their old relationship is to be resumed it must be on a better basis, since the former did not work. This means a new attitude and spirit all around. Sometimes it is to the best interests of all concerned that a couple remain apart. Obviously, no rule can be laid down. Let the alcoholic continue their program day by day. When the time for living together has come, it will be apparent to both parties.

  Let no alcoholic say they cannot recover unless they have their family back. This just isn’t so. In some cases the partner will never come back for one reason or another. Remind the prospect that their recovery is not depen-

PAGE 100

dent upon people. It is dependent upon their relationship with God. We have seen alcoholics get well whose families have not returned at all. We have seen others slip when the family came back too soon.

  Both you and the new recovering alcoholic must walk day by day in the path of spiritual progress. If you persist, remarkable things will happen. When we look back, we realize that the things which came to us when we put ourselves in God’s hands were better than anything we could have planned. Follow the dictates of a Higher Power and you will presently live in a new and wonderful world, no matter what your present circumstances!

  When working with someone and their family, you should take care not to participate in their quarrels. You may spoil your chance of being helpful if you do. But urge upon an alcoholic’s family that that alcoholic has been a very sick person and should be treated accordingly. You should warn against arousing resentment or jealousy. You should point out that the alcoholic’s defects of character are not going to disappear over night. Show them that the alcoholic has entered upon a period of growth. Ask them to remember, when they are impatient, the blessed fact of their sobriety.

  If you have been successful in solving your own domestic problems, tell the newcomer’s family how that was accomplished. In this way you can set them on the right track without becoming critical of them. The story of how you and your partner settled your difficulties is worth any amount of criticism.

  Assuming we are spiritually fit, we can do all sorts of things alcoholics are not supposed to do. People have said we must not go where liquor is served; we

PAGE 101

must not have it in our homes; we must shun friends who drink; we must avoid moving pictures which show drinking scenes; we must not go into bars; our friends must hide their bottles if we go to their houses; we mustn’t think or be reminded about alcohol at all. Our experience shows that this is not necessarily so.

  We meet these conditions every day. An alcoholic who cannot meet them, still has an alcoholic mind; there is something the matter with their spiritual status. Their only chance for sobriety would be some place like the Greenland Ice Cap, and even there an Eskimo might turn up with a bottle of scotch and ruin everything! Ask anyone who has sent their alcoholic partner to distant places on the theory they would escape the alcohol problem.

  In our belief any scheme of combating alcoholism which proposes to shield the sick person from temptation is doomed to failure. If the alcoholic tries to shield themselves they may succeed for a time, but they usually wind up with a bigger explosion than ever. We have tried these methods. These attempts to do the impossible have always failed.

  So our rule is not to avoid a place where there is drinking, _if we have a legitimate reason for being there._ That includes bars, nightclubs, dances, receptions, weddings, even plain ordinary whoopee parties. To a person who has had experience with an alcoholic, this may seem like tempting Providence, but it isn’t.

  You will note that we made an important qualification. Therefore, ask yourself on each occasion, “Have I any good social, business, or personal reason for going to this place? Or am I expecting to steal a little vicarious pleasure from the atmosphere of such

PAGE 102

places?” If you answer these questions satisfactorily, you need have no apprehension. Go or stay away, whichever seems best. But be sure you are on solid spiritual ground before you start and that your motive in going is thoroughly good. Do not think of what you will get out of the occasion. Think of what you can bring to it. But if you are shaky, you had better work with another alcoholic instead!

  Why sit with a long face in places where there is drinking, sighing about the good old days. If it is a happy occasion, try to increase the pleasure of those there; if a business occasion, go and attend to your business enthusiastically. If you are with a person who wants to eat in a bar, by all means go along. Let your friends know they are not to change their habits on your account. At a proper time and place explain to all your friends why alcohol disagrees with you. If you do this thoroughly, few people will ask you to drink. While you were drinking, you were withdrawing from life little by little. Now you are getting back into the social life of this world. Don’t start to withdraw again just because your friends drink liquor.

  Your job now is to be at the place where you may be of maximum helpfulness to others, so never hesitate to go anywhere if you can be helpful. You should not hesitate to visit the most sordid spot on earth on such an errand. Keep on the firing line of life with these motives and God will keep you unharmed.

  Many of us keep liquor in our homes. We often need it to carry green recruits through a severe hangover. Some of us still serve it to our friends provided they are not alcoholic. But some of us think we should not serve liquor to anyone. We never argue this ques-

PAGE 103

tion. We feel that each family, in the light of their own circumstances, ought to decide for themselves.

  We are careful never to show intolerance or hatred of drinking as an institution. Experience shows that such an attitude is not helpful to anyone. Every new alcoholic looks for this spirit among us and is immensely relieved when they find we are not condemnatory. A spirit of intolerance might repel alcoholics whose lives could have been saved, had it not been for such stupidity. We would not even do the cause of temperate drinking any good, for not one drinker in a thousand likes to be told anything about alcohol by one who hates it.

  Some day we hope that Alcoholics Anonymous will help the public to a better realization of the gravity of the alcoholic problem, but we shall be of little use if our attitude is one of bitterness or hostility. Drinkers will not stand for it.

  _After all, our problems were of our own making. Bottles were only a symbol. Besides, we have stopped fighting anybody or anything. We have to!_

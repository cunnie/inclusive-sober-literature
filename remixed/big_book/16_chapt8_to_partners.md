## TO PARTNERS\*

  For every alcoholic who drinks others are involved—the partner who trembles in fear of the next debauch; the parents who see their child wasting away.

  Among us are partners, relatives and friends whose problem has been solved, as well as some who have not yet found a happy solution. We want the partners of Alcoholics Anonymous to address the partners of people who drink too much. What they say will apply to nearly everyone bound by ties of blood or affection to an alcoholic.

  As partners of Alcoholics Anonymous, we would like you to feel that we understand as perhaps few can. We want to analyze mistakes we have made. We want to leave you with the feeling that no situation is too difficult and no unhappiness too great to be overcome.

  We have traveled a rocky road, there is no mistake about that. We have had long rendezvous with hurt pride, frustration, self-pity, misunderstanding and fear. These are not pleasant companions. We have been

\* This chapter was originally entitled "To Wives" and had the following footnote:
> Written in 1939, when there were few women in A.A., this chapter assumes that the alcoholic in the home is likely to be the husband. But many of the suggestions given here may be adapted to help the person who lives with a woman alcoholic—whether she is still drinking or is recovering in A.A. A further source of help is noted on page 121.

driven to maudlin sympathy, to bitter resentment. Some of us veered from extreme to extreme, ever hoping that one day our loved ones would be themselves once more.

  Our loyalty and the desire that our partners hold up their heads and be like other people have begotten all sorts of predicaments. We have been unselfish and self-sacrificing. We have told innumerable lies to protect our pride and our partners’ reputations. We have prayed, we have begged, we have been patient. We have struck out viciously. We have run away. We have been hysterical. We have been terror stricken. We have sought sympathy. We have had retaliatory love affairs with other people.

  Our homes have been battle-grounds many an evening. In the morning we have kissed and made up. Our friends have counseled chucking the partners and we have done so with finality, only to be back in a little while hoping, always hoping. Our partners have sworn great solemn oaths that they were through drinking forever. We have believed them when no one else could or would. Then, in days, weeks, or months, a fresh outburst.

  We seldom had friends at our homes, never knowing how or when the alcoholic of the house would appear. We could make few social engagements. We came to live almost alone. When we were invited out, our partners sneaked so many drinks that they spoiled the occasion. If, on the other hand, they took nothing, their self-pity made them killjoys.

  There was never financial security. Positions were always in jeopardy or gone. An armored car could

PAGE 106

not have brought the pay envelopes home. The checking account melted like snow in June.

  Sometimes there was an affair. How heartbreaking was this discovery; how cruel to be told they understood our partner as we did not!

  The bill collectors, the sheriffs, the angry taxi drivers, the policemen, the bums, the pals, and even the potential affairs they sometimes brought home—our partners thought we were so inhospitable. “Joykiller, nag, wet blanket”—that’s what they said. Next day they would be themselves again and we would forgive and try to forget.

  We have tried to hold the love of our children for their alcoholic parent. We have told small tots that parent was sick, which was much nearer the truth than we realized. They struck the children, kicked out door panels, smashed treasured crockery, and ripped the keys out of pianos. In the midst of such pandemonium they may have rushed out threatening to live with the other lover forever. In desperation, we have even got tight ourselves—the drunk to end all drunks. The unexpected result was that our partners seemed to like it.

  Perhaps at this point we got a divorce and took the children home to our parents. Then we were severely criticized by our partner’s parents for desertion. Usually we did not leave. We stayed on and on. If we were stay-at-home care-givers, we may have finally sought employment ourselves as destitution faced us and our families.

  We began to ask medical advice as the sprees got closer together. The alarming physical and mental symptoms, the deepening pall of remorse, depression and inferiority that settled down on our loved ones—

PAGE 107

these things terrified and distracted us. As animals on a treadmill, we have patiently and wearily climbed, falling back in exhaustion after each futile effort to reach solid ground. Most of us have entered the final stage with its commitment to health resorts, sanitariums, hospitals, and jails. Sometimes there were screaming delirium and insanity. Death was often near.

  Under these conditions we naturally made mistakes. Some of them rose out of ignorance of alcoholism. Sometimes we sensed dimly that we were dealing with sick person. Had we fully understood the nature of the alcoholic illness, we might have behaved differently.

  How could people who loved their partners and children be so unthinking, so callous, so cruel? There could be no love in such persons, we thought. And just as we were being convinced of their heartlessness, they would surprise us with fresh resolves and new attentions. For a while they would be their old sweet selves, only to dash the new structure of affection to pieces once more. Asked why they commenced to drink again, they would reply with some silly excuse, or none. It was so baffling, so heartbreaking. Could we have been so mistaken in the ones chose to love? When drinking, they were strangers. Sometimes they were so inaccessible that it seemed as though a great wall had been built around them.

  And even if they did not love their families, how could they be so blind about themselves? What had become of their judgment, their common sense, their will power? Why could they not see that drink meant ruin to them? Why was it, when these dangers were

PAGE 108

pointed out that they agreed, and then got drunk again immediately?

  These are some of the questions which race through the mind of every person who has an alcoholic partner. We hope this book has answered some of them. Perhaps your partner has been living in that strange world of alcoholism where everything is distorted and exaggerated. You can see that they really do love you with their better self. Of course, there is such a thing as incompatibility, but in nearly every instance the alcoholic only seems to be unloving and inconsiderate; it is usually because they are warped and sickened that they say and do these appalling things. Today most of our significant others are better partners and parents than ever before.

  Try not to condemn your alcoholic partner no matter what they say or do. They are just another very sick, unreasonable person. Treat them, when you can, as though they have pneumonia. When they anger you, remember that they are very ill.

  There is an important exception to the foregoing. We realize some alcoholics are thoroughly bad-intentioned, that no amount of patience will make any difference. An alcoholic of this temperament may be quick to use this chapter as a club over your head. Don’t let them get away with it. If you are positive they are one of this type you may feel you had better leave. Is it right to let them ruin your life and the lives of your children? Especially when they have before them a way to stop their drinking and abuse if they really want to pay the price.

  The problem with which you struggle usually falls within one of four categories:

  *One:* Your partner may be only a heavy drinker.

PAGE 109

their drinking may be constant or it may be heavy only on certain occasions. Perhaps they spend too much money for liquor. It may be slowing them up mentally and physically, but they do not see it. Sometimes they are a source of embarrassment to you and their friends. They are positive they can handle their liquor, that it does them no harm, that drinking is necessary in their business. They would probably be insulted if they were called an alcoholic. This world is full of people like them. Some will moderate or stop altogether, and some will not. Of those who keep on, a good number will become true alcoholics after a while.

  *Two:* Your partner is showing lack of control, for they are unable to stay on the water wagon even when they want to. They often get entirely out of hand when drinking. They admit this is true, but is positive that they will do better. They have begun to try, with or without your cooperation, various means of moderating or staying dry. Maybe they are beginning to lose their friends. Their business may suffer somewhat. They are worried at times, and is becoming aware that they cannot drink like other people. They sometimes drink in the morning and through the day also, to hold their nervousness in check. They are remorseful after serious drinking bouts and tells you they want to stop. But when they get over the spree, they begin to think once more how they can drink moderately next time. We think this person is in danger. These are the earmarks of a real alcoholic. Perhaps they can still tend to business fairly well. They have by no means ruined everything. As we say among ourselves, “They want to want to stop.”

  *Three:* This partner has gone much further than partner number two. Though once like number two

PAGE 110

they became worse. Their friends have slipped away, their home is a near-wreck and they cannot hold a position. Maybe the doctor has been called in, and the weary round of sanitariums and hospitals has begun. They admit they cannot drink like other people, but does not see why. They cling to the notion that they will yet find a way to do so. They may have come to the point where they desperately want to stop but cannot. Their case presents additional questions which we shall try to answer for you. You can be quite hopeful of a situation like this.

  *Four:* You may have a partner of whom you completely despair. They have been placed in one institution after another. They are violent, or appears definitely insane when drunk. Sometimes they drink on the way home from the hospital. Perhaps they have had delirium tremens. Doctors may shake their heads and advise you to have them committed. Maybe you have already been obliged to put them away. This picture may not be as dark as it looks. Many of our partners were just as far gone. Yet they got well.

  Let’s now go back to partner number one. Oddly enough, they are often difficult to deal with. They enjoy drinking. It stirs their imagination. Their friends feel closer over a highball. Perhaps you enjoy drinking with your partner yourself when they don’t go too far. You have passed happy evenings together chatting and drinking before your fire. Perhaps you both like parties which would be dull without liquor. We have enjoyed such evenings ourselves; we had a good time. We know all about liquor as a social lubricant. Some, but not all of us, think it has its advantages when reasonably used.

PAGE 111

  The first principle of success is that you should never be angry. Even though your partner becomes unbearable and you have to leave them temporarily, you should, if you can, go without rancor. Patience and good temper are most necessary.

  Our next thought is that you should never tell them what they must do about their drinking. If they get the idea that you are a nag or a killjoy, your chance of accomplishing anything useful may be zero. They will use that as an excuse to drink more. They will tell you they are misunderstood. This may lead to lonely evenings for you. They may seek someone else to console them—not always someone who's just a friend.

  Be determined that your partner’s drinking is not going to spoil your relations with your children or your friends. They need your companionship and your help. It is possible to have a full and useful life, though your partner continues to drink. We know people who are unafraid, even happy under these conditions. Do not set your heart on reforming your partner. You may be unable to do so, no matter how hard you try.

  We know these suggestions are sometimes difficult to follow, but you will save many a heartbreak if you can succeed in observing them. Your partner may come to appreciate your reasonableness and patience. This may lay the groundwork for a friendly talk about their alcoholic problem. Try to have them bring up the subject themselves. Be sure you are not critical during such a discussion. Attempt instead, to put yourself in their place. Let them see that you want to be helpful rather than critical.

  When a discussion does arise, you might suggest they

PAGE 112

read this book or at least the chapter on alcoholism. Tell them you have been worried, though perhaps needlessly. You think they ought to know the subject better, as everyone should have a clear understanding of the risk they take if they drink too much. Show them you have confidence in their power to stop or moderate. Say you do not want to be a wet blanket; that you only want them to take care of their health. Thus you may succeed in interesting them in alcoholism.

  They probably have several alcoholics among their own acquaintances. You might suggest that you both take an interest in them. Drinkers like to help other drinkers. Your partner may be willing to talk to one of them.

  If this kind of approach does not catch your partner’s interest, it may be best to drop the subject, but after a friendly talk your partner will usually revive the topic themselves. This may take patient waiting, but it will be worth it. Meanwhile you might try to help the partners of another serious drinker. If you act upon these principles, your partner may stop or moderate.

  Suppose, however, that your partner fits the description of number two. The same principles which apply to partner number one should be practiced. But after their next binge, ask them if they would really like to get over drinking for good. Do not ask that they do it for you or anyone else. Just would they like to?

  The chances are they would. Show them your copy of this book and tell them what you have found out about alcoholism. Show them that as alcoholics, the writers of the book understand. Tell them some of the interesting stories you have read. If you think they will be shy of a spiritual remedy, ask them to look at the chapter on

PAGE 113

alcoholism. Then perhaps they will be interested enough to continue.

  If they are enthusiastic your cooperation will mean a great deal. If they are lukewarm or thinks they are not an alcoholic, we suggest you leave them alone. Avoid urging them to follow our program. The seed has been planted in their mind. They know that thousands of alcoholics, much like themselves, have recovered. But don’t remind them of this after they have been drinking, for they may be angry. Sooner or later, you are likely to find them reading the book once more. Wait until repeated stumbling convinces them they must act, for the more you hurry them the longer their recovery may be delayed.

  If you have a number three partner, you may be in luck. Being certain they want to stop, you can go to them with this volume as joyfully as though you had struck oil. They may not share your enthusiasm, but they are practically sure to read the book and they may go for the program at once. If they do not, you will probably not have long to wait. Again, you should not crowd them. Let them decide for themselves. Cheerfully see them through more sprees. Talk about their condition or this book only when they raises the issue. In some cases it may be better to let someone outside the family present the book. They can urge action without arousing hostility. If your partner is otherwise a normal individual, your chances are good at this stage.

  You would suppose that alcoholics in the fourth classification would be quite hopeless, but that is not so. Many of Alcoholics Anonymous were like that. Everybody had given them up. Defeat seemed certain. Yet often such alcoholics had spectacular and powerful recoveries.

PAGE 114

  There are exceptions. Some alcoholics have been so impaired by alcohol that they cannot stop. Sometimes there are cases where alcoholism is complicated by other disorders. A good doctor or psychiatrist can tell you whether these complications are serious. In any event, try to have your partner read this book. Their reaction may be one of enthusiasm. If they are already committed to an institution, but can convince you and your doctor that they mean business, give them a chance to try our method, unless the doctor thinks their mental condition too abnormal or dangerous. We make this recommendation with some confidence. For years we have been working with alcoholics committed to institutions. Since this book was first published, A.A. has released thousands of alcoholics from asylums and hospitals of every kind. The majority have never returned. The power of God goes deep!

  You may have the reverse situation on your hands. Perhaps you have a partner who is at large, but who should be committed. Some alcoholics cannot or will not get over alcoholism. When they become too dangerous, we think the kind thing is to lock them up, but of course a good doctor should always be consulted. The partners and children of such alcoholics suffer horribly, but not more than the alcoholics themselves.

  But sometimes you must start life anew. We know partners of alcoholics who have done it. If such people adopt a spiritual way of life their road will be smoother.

  If your partner is a drinker, you probably worry over what other people are thinking and you hate to meet your friends. You draw more and more into yourself and you think everyone is talking about conditions at your home. You avoid the subject of drink­

PAGE 115

ing, even with your own parents. You do not know what to tell the children. When your partner is bad, you become a trembling recluse, wishing the telephone had never been invented.

  We find that most of this embarrassment is unnecessary. While you need not discuss your partner at length, you can quietly let your friends know the nature of their illness. But you must be on guard not to embarrass or harm your partner.

  When you have carefully explained to such people that they are a sick person, you will have created a new atmosphere. Barriers which have sprung up between you and your friends will disappear with the growth of sympathetic understanding. You will no longer be self-conscious or feel that you must apologize as though your partner were a weak character. They may be anything but that. Your new courage, good nature and lack of self-consciousness will do wonders for you socially.

  The same principle applies in dealing with the children. Unless they actually need protection from their alcoholic parent, it is best not to take sides in any argument they have with them while drinking. Use your energies to promote a better understanding all around. Then that terrible tension which grips the home of every problem drinker will be lessened.

  Frequently, you have felt obliged to tell your partner’s employer and their friends that they were sick, when as a matter of fact they were tight. Avoid answering these inquiries as much as you can. Whenever possible, let your partner explain. Your desire to protect them should not cause you to lie to people when they have a right to know where they are and what they are doing. Dis­

PAGE 116

cuss this with them when they are sober and in good spirits. Ask them what you should do if they place you in such a position again. But be careful not to be resentful about the last time they did so.

  There is another paralyzing fear. You may be afraid your partner will lose their position; you are thinking of the disgrace and hard times which will befall you and the children. This experience may come to you. Or you may already have had it several times. Should it happen again, regard it in a different light. Maybe it will prove a blessing! It may convince your partner they want to stop drinking forever. And now you know that they can stop if they will! Time after time, this apparent calamity has been a boon to us, for it opened up a path which led to the discovery of God.

  We have elsewhere remarked how much better life is when lived on a spiritual plane. If God can solve the age-old riddle of alcoholism, God can solve your problems too. We partners of alcoholics found that, like everybody else, we were afflicted with pride, self-pity, vanity and all the things which go to make up the self-centered person; and we were not above selfishness or dishonesty. As our partners began to apply spiritual principles in their lives, we began to see the desirability of doing so too.

  At first, some of us did not believe we needed this help. We thought, on the whole, we were pretty good people, capable of being nicer if our partner stopped drinking. But it was a silly idea that we were too good to need God. Now we try to put spiritual principles to work in every department of our lives. When we do that, we find it solves our problems too; the ensuing lack of fear, worry and hurt feelings is a wonderful

PAGE 117

thing. We urge you to try our program, for nothing will be so helpful to your partner as the radically changed attitude toward them which God will show you how to have. Go along with your partner if you possibly can.

  If you and your partner find a solution for the pressing problem of drink you are, of course, going to be very happy. But all problems will not be solved at once. Seed has started to sprout in a new soil, but growth has only begun. In spite of your new-found happiness, there will be ups and downs. Many of the old problems will still be with you. This is as it should be.

  The faith and sincerity of both you and your partner will be put to the test. These work-outs should be regarded as part of your education, for thus you will be learning to live. You will make mistakes, but if you are in earnest they will not drag you down. Instead, you will capitalize them. A better way of life will emerge when they are overcome.

  Some of the snags you will encounter are irritation, hurt feelings and resentments. Your partner will sometimes be unreasonable and you will want to criticize. Starting from a speck on the domestic horizon, great thunderclouds of dispute may gather. These family dissensions are very dangerous, especially to your partner. Often you must carry the burden of avoiding them or keeping them under control. Never forget that resentment is a deadly hazard to an alcoholic. We do not mean that you have to agree with your partner whenever there is an honest difference of opinion. Just be careful not to disagree in a resentful or critical spirit.

PAGE 118

  You and your partner will find that you can dispose of serious problems easier than you can the trivial ones. Next time you both have a heated discussion, no matter what the subject, it should be the privilege of either to smile and say, “This is getting serious. I’m sorry I got disturbed. Let’s talk about it later.” If your partner is trying to live on a spiritual basis, they will also be doing everything in their power to avoid disagreement or contention.

  Your partner knows they owe you more than sobriety. They want to make good. Yet you must not expect too much. Their ways of thinking and doing are the habits of years. Patience, tolerance, understanding and love are the watchwords. Show them these things in yourself and they will be reflected back to you from them. Live and let live is the rule. If you both show a willingness to remedy your own defects, there will be little need to criticize each other.

  We partners of alcoholics carry with us a picture of the ideal partner, the sort of chap we would like our partners to be. It is the most natural thing in the world, once their liquor problem is solved, to feel that they will now measure up to that cherished vision. The chances are they will not for, like yourself, they are just beginning their development. Be patient.

  Another feeling we are very likely to entertain is one of resentment that love and loyalty could not cure our partners of alcoholism. We do not like the thought that the contents of a book or the work of another alcoholic has accomplished in a few weeks that for which we struggled for years. At such moments we forget that alcoholism is an illness over which we could not possibly have had any power. Your partner will

PAGE 119

be the first to say it was your devotion and care which brought them to the point where they could have a spiritual experience. Without you they would have gone to pieces long ago. When resentful thoughts come, try to pause and count your blessings. After all, your family is reunited, alcohol is no longer a problem and you and your partner are working together toward an undreamed-of future.

  Still another difficulty is that you may become jealous of the attention they bestow on other people, especially alcoholics. You have been starving for their companionship, yet they spend long hours helping other alcoholics and their families. You feel they should now be yours. The fact is that they should work with other people to maintain their own sobriety. Sometimes they will be so interested that they become really neglectful. Your house is filled with strangers. You may not like some of them. They get stirred up about their fellow alcoholics' troubles, but not at all about yours. It will do little good if you point that out and urge more attention for yourself. We find it a real mistake to dampen their enthusiasm for alcoholic work. You should join in their efforts as much as you possibly can. We suggest that you direct some of your thought to the partners of your alcoholic's new alcoholic friends. They need the counsel and love of someone who has gone through what you have.

  It is probably true that you and your partner have been living too much alone, for drinking many times isolates the partner of an alcoholic. Therefore, you probably need fresh interests and a great cause to live for as much as your partner. If you cooperate, rather than complain, you will find that their excess enthusiasm will tone down. Both of you will awaken to a new

PAGE 120

sense of responsibility for others. You, as well as your partner, ought to think of what you can put into life instead of how much you can take out. Inevitably your lives will be fuller for doing so. You will lose the old life to find one much better.

  Perhaps your partner will make a fair start on the new basis, but just as things are going beautifully they dismay you by coming home drunk. If you are satisfied they really want to get over drinking, you need not be alarmed. Though it is infinitely better that they have no relapse at all, as has been true with many of our fellow alcoholics, it is by no means a bad thing in some cases. Your partner will see at once that they must redouble their spiritual activities if they expect to survive. You need not remind them of their spiritual deficiency—they will know of it. Cheer them up and ask them how you can be still more helpful.

  The slightest sign of fear or intolerance may lessen your partner’s chance of recovery. In a weak moment they may take your dislike of their high-stepping friends as one of those insanely trivial excuses to drink.

  We never, never try to arrange an alcoholic’s life so as to shield them from temptation. The slightest disposition on your part to guide their appointments or their affairs so they will not be tempted will be noticed. Make them feel absolutely free to come and go as they like. This is important. If they get drunk, don’t blame yourself. God has either removed your partner’s liquor problem or God has not. If not, it had better be found out right away. Then you and your partner can get right down to fundamentals. If a repetition is to be prevented, place the problem, along with everything else, in God’s hands.

PAGE 121

  We realize that we have been giving you much direction and advice. We may have seemed to lecture. If that is so we are sorry, for we ourselves don’t always care for people who lecture us. But what we have related is based upon experience, some of it painful. We had to learn these things the hard way. That is why we are anxious that you understand, and that you avoid these unnecessary difficulties.\*

  So to you out there who may soon be with us—we say “Good luck and God bless you!”

## THE FAMILY AFTERWARD

  Our partners have suggested certain attitudes a partner of an alcoholic may take with the partner who is recovering. Perhaps they created the impression that they are to be wrapped in cotton wool and placed on a pedestal. Successful readjustment means the opposite. All members of the family should meet upon the common ground of tolerance, understanding and love. This involves a process of deflation. The alcoholic, their partner, their children, their “in-laws,” each one is likely to have fixed ideas about the family’s attitude towards themselves. Each is interested in having their wishes respected. We find the more one member of the family demands that the others concede to them, the more resentful the family becomes. This makes for discord and unhappiness.

  And why? Is it not because each wants to play the lead? Is not each trying to arrange the family show to their liking? Are they not unconsciously trying to see what they can take from the family life rather than give?

  Cessation of drinking is but the first step away from a highly strained, abnormal condition. A doctor said to us, “Years of living with an alcoholic is almost sure to make any partner or child neurotic. The entire family is, to some extent, ill.” Let families realize, as they start their journey, that all will not be fair weather. Each in their turn may be footsore and may straggle.

PAGE 123

There will be alluring shortcuts and by-paths down which they may wander and lose their way.

  Suppose we tell you some of the obstacles a family will meet; suppose we suggest how they may be avoided—even converted to good use for others. The family of an alcoholic longs for the return of happiness and security. They remember when the alcoholic was romantic, thoughtful and successful. Today’s life is measured against that of other years and, when it falls short, the family may be unhappy.

  Family confidence in the recovering alcoholic is rising high. The good old days will soon be back, they think. Sometimes they demand that the alcoholic bring them back instantly! God, they believe, almost owes this recompense on a long overdue account. But the head of the house has spent years in pulling down the structures of business, romance, friendship, health—these things are now ruined or damaged. It will take time to clear away the wreck. Though old buildings will eventually be replaced by finer ones, the new structures will take years to complete.

  The alcoholic knows they are to blame; it may take them many seasons of hard work to be restored financially, but they shouldn’t be reproached. Perhaps they will never have much money again. But the wise family will admire them for what they are trying to be, rather than for what they are trying to get.

  Now and then the family will be plagued by spectres from the past, for the drinking career of almost every alcoholic has been marked by escapades, funny, humiliating, shameful or tragic. The first impulse will be to bury these skeletons in a dark closet and padlock the door. The family may be possessed by the idea

PAGE 124

that future happiness can be based only upon forgetfulness of the past. We think that such a view is selfcentered and in direct conflict with the new way of living.

  Henry Ford once made a wise remark to the effect that experience is the thing of supreme value in life. That is true only if one is willing to turn the past to good account. We grow by our willingness to face and rectify errors and convert them into assets. The alcoholic’s past thus becomes the principal asset of the family and frequently it is almost the only one!

  This painful past may be of infinite value to other families still struggling with their problem. We think each family which has been relieved owes something to those who have not, and when the occasion requires, each member of it should be only too willing to bring former mistakes, no matter how grievous, out of their hiding places. Showing others who suffer how we were given help is the very thing which makes life seem so worth while to us now. Cling to the thought that, in God’s hands, the dark past is the greatest possession you have—the key to life and happiness for others. With it you can avert death and misery for them.

  It is possible to dig up past misdeeds so they become a blight, a veritable plague. For example, we know of situations in which the alcoholic or their partner have had love affairs. In the first flush of spiritual experience they forgave each other and drew closer together. The miracle of reconciliation was at hand. Then, under one provocation or another, the aggrieved one would unearth the old affair and angrily cast its ashes about. A few of us have had these growing pains and they

PAGE 125

hurt a great deal. Alcoholics and their partners have sometimes been obliged to separate for a time until new perspective, new victory over hurt pride could be rewon. In most cases, the alcoholic survived this ordeal without relapse, but not always. So we think that unless some good and useful purpose is to be served, past occurrences should not be discussed.

  We families of Alcoholics Anonymous keep few skeletons in the closet. Everyone knows about the others’ alcoholic troubles. This is a condition which, in ordinary life, would produce untold grief; there might be scandalous gossip, laughter at the expense of other people, and a tendency to take advantage of intimate information. Among us, these are rare occurrences. We do talk about each other a great deal, but we almost invariably temper such talk by a spirit of love and tolerance.

  Another principle we observe carefully is that we do not relate intimate experiences of another person unless we are sure they would approve. We find it better, when possible, to stick to our own stories. An person may criticize or laugh at themselves and it will affect others favorably, but criticism or ridicule coming from another often produces the contrary effect. Members of a family should watch such matters carefully, for one careless, inconsiderate remark has been known to raise the very devil. We alcoholics are sensitive people. It takes some of us a long time to outgrow that serious handicap.

  Many alcoholics are enthusiasts. They run to extremes. At the beginning of recovery they will take, as a rule, one of two directions. They may either plunge into a frantic attempt to get on their feet in business, or

PAGE 126

they may be so enthralled by their new life that they talk or think of little else. In either case certain family problems will arise. With these we have had experience galore.

  We think it dangerous if they rush headlong at their economic problem. The family will be affected also, pleasantly at first, as they feel their money troubles are about to be solved, then not so pleasantly as they find themselves neglected. The reconvering alcoholic may be tired at night and preoccupied by day. They may take small interest in the children and may show irritation when reproved for their delinquencies. If not irritable, they may seem dull and boring, not gay and affectionate as the family would like them to be. The partner may complain of inattention. They are all disappointed, and often let them feel it. Beginning with such complaints, a barrier arises. They are straining every nerve to make up for lost time. They are striving to recover fortune and reputation and feels they are doing very well.

  Sometimes the the family doesn't think so. Having been neglected and misused in the past, they think they are owed more than they are getting. They want more attention. They expect the alcoholic to give them the nice times they used to have before they drank so much, and to show contrition for what the family suffered. But the alcoholic doesn’t give freely of themselves. Resentment grows. They become still less communicative. Sometimes they explode over a trifle. The family is mystified. They criticize, pointing out how the alcoholic is falling down on their spiritual program.

  This sort of thing can be avoided. Both the alcoholic and the family are mistaken, though each side may have some justification. It is of little use to argue and only

PAGE 127

makes the impasse worse. The family must realize that the alcoholic, though marvelously improved, is still convalescing. They should be thankful they are sober and able to be of this world once more. Let the family praise the alcoholic's progress. Let the family remember that the alcoholic's drinking wrought all kinds of damage that may take long to repair. If the family senses these things, they will not take so seriously the alcoholic's periods of crankiness, depression, or apathy, which will disappear when there is tolerance, love, and spiritual understanding.

  The alcoholic ought to remember that they are mainly to blame for what befell their home. They can scarcely square the account in their lifetime. But they must see the danger of over-concentration on financial success. Although financial recovery is on the way for many of us, we found we could not place money first. For us, material well-being always followed spiritual progress; it never preceded.

  Since the home has suffered more than anything else, it is well that a recovering alcoholic exert themselves there. They are not likely to get far in any direction if they fail to show unselfishness and love under their own roof. We know there are difficult partners and families, but the person who is getting over alcoholism must remember they did much to make them so.

  As each member of a resentful family begins to see their shortcomings and admits them to the others, they lay a basis for helpful discussion. These family talks will be constructive if they can be carried on without heated argument, self-pity, self-justification or resentful criticism. Little by little, the family will see they ask too much, and the alcoholic will see they give too

PAGE 128

little. Giving, rather than getting, will become the guiding principle.

  Assume on the other hand that they alcoholic has, at the outset, a stirring spiritual experience. Overnight, as it were, they are a different person. They become a religious enthusiast. They are unable to focus on anything else. As soon as their sobriety begins to be taken as a matter of course, the family may look at their strange new family member with apprehension, then with irritation. There is talk about spiritual matters morning, noon and night. They may demand that the family find God in a hurry, or exhibit amazing indifference to the family and say they are above worldly considerations. They may tell the partner, who has been religious all their life, that they don't know what it’s all about, and that they had better get the alcoholic's brand of spirituality while there is yet time.

  When the alcoholic takes this tack, the family may react unfavorably. They may be jealous of a God who has stolen their family member’s affections. While grateful that they drink no more, the family may not like the idea that God has accomplished the miracle where they failed. They often forget the alcoholic was beyond human aid. They may not see why their love and devotion did not straighten the alcoholic out. The alcoholic is not so spiritual after all, they say. If the alcoholic means to right their past wrongs, why all this concern for everyone in the world but their family? What about their talk that God will take care of them? The family suspect the alcoholic is a bit balmy!

  They are not so unbalanced as the family might think. Many of us have experienced such an alcoholic’s elation. We have indulged in spiritual intoxication. Like a gaunt prospector, belt drawn in over the last ounce of food, our pick struck gold. Joy at our release from a lifetime of

PAGE 129

frustration knew no bounds. The alcoholic feels they have struck something better than gold. For a time they may try to hug the new treasure to themselves. They may not see at once that they have barely scratched a limitless lode which will pay dividends only if they mine it for the rest of their life and insists on giving away the entire product.

  If the family cooperates, the alcoholic will soon see that they are suffering from a distortion of values. They will perceive that their spiritual growth is lopsided, that for an average person like themselves, a spiritual life which does not include their family obligations may not be so perfect after all. If the family will appreciate that the recovering alcoholic’s current behavior is but a phase of their development, all will be well. In the midst of an understanding and sympathetic family, these vagaries of the alcoholic’s spiritual infancy will quickly disappear.

  The opposite may happen should the family condemn and criticize. The alcoholic may feel that for years their drinking has placed them on the wrong side of every argument, but that now they have become a superior person with God on their side. If the family persists in criticism, this fallacy may take a still greater hold on the alcoholic. Instead of treating the family as they should, they may retreat further into themselves and feel they have spiritual justification for so doing.

  Though the family does not fully agree with the alcoholic’s spiritual activities, they should let them have their head. Even if they display a certain amount of neglect and irresponsibility towards the family, it is well to let them go as far as they like in helping other alcoholics. During those first days of convalescence, this will do more to insure their sobriety than anything else. Though

PAGE 130

some of their manifestations are alarming and disagreeable, we think they will be on a firmer foundation than the person who is placing business or professional success ahead of spiritual development. They will be less likely to drink again, and anything is preferable to that.

  Those of us who have spent much time in the world of spiritual make-believe have eventually seen the childishness of it. This dream world has been replaced by a great sense of purpose, accompanied by a growing consciousness of the power of God in our lives. We have come to believe God would like us to keep our heads in the clouds with God, but that our feet ought to be firmly planted on earth. That is where our fellow travelers are, and that is where our work must be done. These are the realities for us. We have found nothing incompatible between a powerful spiritual experience and a life of sane and happy usefulness.

  One more suggestion: Whether the family has spiritual convictions or not, they may do well to examine the principles by which the alcoholic member is trying to live. They can hardly fail to approve these simple principles, though the head of the house still fails somewhat in practicing them. Nothing will help the alcoholic who is off on a spiritual tangent so much as the partner who adopts a sane spiritual program, making a better practical use of it.

  There will be other profound changes in the household. Liquor incapacitated the alcoholic for so many years that the partner may have had to take on the alcoholic's responsibilities. The partner met these responsibilities gallantly. By force of circumstances, they were often obliged to treat the alcoholic as a sick or wayward child. Even when the alcoholic wanted to assert themselves

PAGE 131

they could not, for their drinking placed them constantly in the wrong. The partner made all the plans and gave the directions. When sober, the alcoholic usually obeyed. Thus the partner, out of necessity, assumed almost all of the responsibilities for taking care of the family both financially and at home. The alcoholic, coming suddenly to life again, often begins to assert themselves. This means trouble, unless the family watches for these tendencies in each other and comes to a friendly agreement about them.

  Drinking isolates most homes from the outside world. The alcoholic may have laid aside for years all normal activities—clubs, civic duties, sports. When they renew interest in such things, a feeling of jealousy may arise. The family may feel they hold a mortgage on the alcoholic, so big that no equity should be left for outsiders. Instead of developing new channels of activity for themselves, the family members demand that the alcoholic stay home and make up the deficiency.

  At the very beginning, the couple ought to frankly face the fact that each will have to yield here and there if the family is going to play an effective part in the new life. The alcoholic will necessarily spend much time with other alcoholics, but this activity should be balanced. New acquaintances who know nothing of alcoholism might be made and thoughtful consideration given their needs. The problems of the community might engage attention. Though the family has no religious connections, they may wish to make contact with or take membership in a religious body.

  Alcoholics who have derided religious people will be helped by such contacts. Being possessed of a spiritual experience, the alcoholic will find they have much in common with these people, though the alcoholic may

PAGE 132

differ with them on many matters. If the alcoholic does not argue about religion, they will make new friends and is sure to find new avenues of usefulness and pleasure. They and their family can be a bright spot in such congregations. They may bring new hope and new courage to many a priest, minister, rabbi, or other religious leader who give their all to minister to our troubled world. We intend the foregoing as a helpful suggestion only. So far as we are concerned, there is nothing obligatory about it. As non-denominational people, we cannot make up others’ minds for them. Each individual should consult their own conscience.

  We have been speaking to you of serious, sometimes tragic things. We have been dealing with alcohol in its worst aspect. But we aren’t a glum lot. If newcomers could see no joy or fun in our existence, they wouldn’t want it. We absolutely insist on enjoying life. We try not to indulge in cynicism over the state of the nations, nor do we carry the world’s troubles on our shoulders. When we see someone sinking into the mire that is alcoholism, we give them first aid and place what we have at their disposal. For their sake, we do recount and almost relive the horrors of our past. But those of us who have tried to shoulder the entire burden and trouble of others find we are soon overcome by them.

  So we think cheerfulness and laughter make for usefulness. Outsiders are sometimes shocked when we burst into merriment over a seemingly tragic experience out of the past. But why shouldn’t we laugh? We have recovered, and have been given the power to help others.

  Everybody knows that those in bad health, and those who seldom play, do not laugh much. So let

PAGE 133

each family play together or separately, as much as their circumstances warrant. We are sure God wants us to be happy, joyous, and free. We cannot subscribe to the belief that this life is a vale of tears, though it once was just that for many of us. But it is clear that we made our own misery. God didn’t do it. Avoid then, the deliberate manufacture of misery, but if trouble comes, cheerfully capitalize it as an opportunity to demonstrate God's omnipotence.

  Now about health: A body badly burned by alcohol does not often recover overnight nor do twisted thinking and depression vanish in a twinkling. We are convinced that a spiritual mode of living is a most powerful health restorative. We, who have recovered from serious drinking, are miracles of mental health. But we have seen remarkable transformations in our bodies. Hardly one of our crowd now shows any mark of dissipation.

  But this does not mean that we disregard human health measures. God has abundantly supplied this world with fine doctors, psychologists, and practitioners of various kinds. Do not hesitate to take your health problems to such persons. Most of them give freely of themselves, that their fellows may enjoy sound minds and bodies. Try to remember that though God has wrought miracles among us, we should never belittle a good doctor or psychiatrist. Their services are often indispensable in treating a newcomer and in following their case afterward.

  One of the many doctors who had the opportunity of reading this book in manuscript form told us that the use of sweets was often helpful, of course depending upon a doctor’s advice. He thought all alcoholics

PAGE 134

should constantly have chocolate available for its quick energy value at times of fatigue. He added that occasionally in the night a vague craving arose which would be satisfied by candy. Many of us have noticed a tendency to eat sweets and have found this practice beneficial.

  A word about sex relations. Alcohol is so sexually stimulating to some alcoholics that they have over-indulged. Couples are occasionally dismayed to find that when drinking is stopped the alcoholic tends to have a decreased libido. Unless the reason is understood, there may be an emotional upset. Some of us had this experience, only to enjoy, in a few months, a finer intimacy than ever. There should be no hesitancy in consulting a doctor or psychologist if the condition persists. We do not know of many cases where this difficulty lasted long.

  The alcoholic may find it hard to re-establish friendly relations with their children. Their young minds were impressionable while the alcoholic was drinking. Without saying so, they may cordially hate the alcoholic parent for what they have done to them and to their non-alcoholic parent. The children are sometimes dominated by a pathetic hardness and cynicism. They cannot seem to forgive and forget. This may hang on for months, long after their non-alcoholic parent has accepted the alcoholic parent’s new way of living and thinking.

  In time they will see that the alcoholic parent is a new person and in their own way the children will let them know it. When this happens, the children can be invited to join in morning meditation and then they can take part in the daily discussion without rancor or bias. From that point on, progress will be rapid. Marvelous results often follow such a reunion.

PAGE 135

  Whether the family goes on a spiritual basis or not, the alcoholic member has to if they would recover. The others must be convinced of their new status beyond the shadow of a doubt. Seeing is believing to most families who have lived with a drinker.

  Here is a case in point: One of our friends is a heavy smoker and coffee drinker. There was no doubt he over-indulged. Seeing this, and meaning to be helpful, his wife commenced to admonish him about it. He admitted he was overdoing these things, but frankly said that he was not ready to stop. His wife is one of those persons who really feels there is something rather sinful about these commodities, so she nagged, and her intolerance finally threw him into a fit of anger. He got drunk.

  Of course our friend was wrong—dead wrong. He had to painfully admit that and mend his spiritual fences. Though he is now a most effective member of Alcoholics Anonymous, he still smokes and drinks coffee, but neither his wife nor anyone else stands in judgment. She sees she was wrong to make a burning issue out of such a matter when his more serious ailments were being rapidly cured. We have three little mottoes which are apropos. Here they are:

> First Things First  
> Live and Let Live  
> Easy Does It.

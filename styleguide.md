## Gender of God 
Avoid using any pronouns when referencing God.
### Old
> God as we understood Him 
### New

## Opting for singular they
Replace gendered pronouns with singular they. Try to establish singular they by having a clear singular subject antecedent. When there are multiple "they" pronouns in a sentence, make sure that each usage of "they" has its antecedent appear before any other "they" pronouns that refer to different antecedents. Otherwise restate the antecedent.

### Old
> No matter how much one wishes to try, exactly how can he turn his own will and his own life over to the care of whatever God he thinks there is?
### New

## Using person instead of "man"
### Old
This brave philosophy, wherein each man plays God, sounds good in the speaking, but it still has to meet the acid test: how well does it actually work?
### New
This brave philosophy, wherein each person plays God, sounds good in the speaking, but it still has to meet the acid test: how well does it actually work?

## Avoid using "man and woman"
While these uses are trying to be more inclusive, they still exclude non-binary individuals. Replace "man and woman" with something like "person".
### Old
Every man and woman who has joined A.A. and intends to stick has, without realizing it, made a beginning on Step Three.
### New
Every person who has joined A.A. and intends to stick has, without realizing it, made a beginning on Step Three.
### Old

### New
No adult, for example, should be in too much emotional dependence upon a parent.

## Avoid words that assume a group of people are all male
E.g.: brotherhood and mankind
### Old
The sum of all this mighty effort is less peace and less brotherhood than before.
### New
The sum of all this mighty effort is less peace and less kinship than before.

## Use "parent" instead of "mother" or "father"

## Keep gendered pronouns if they refer to specific people
### Unchanged
So did a friend of mine who was a one-time vice-president of the American Atheist Society, but he got through with room to spare.”

## Improve gendered language in quotes using brackets
### Old
“THIS is the Step that separates the men from the boys.” So declares a well-loved clergyman who happens to be one of A.A.’s greatest friends.
### New
“THIS is the Step that separates the [adults] from the [children].” So declares a well-loved clergyperson who happens to be one of A.A.’s greatest friends.

## Using fellow and fellowship is OK
While some dictionaries have archaic or obsolete definitions of fellow as masculine. However, ["fellow" itself is etymologically gender neutral]. In a survey of different online discussion boards, most people tend to agree that fellow in most modern usages is gender neutral. Lastly, in prior art, [Inclusive Big Book], is does not change instances of "fellow" and "fellows". There are some instances in the text here, that we have remixed "fellow" singular into "someone" or "person" when it seemed appropriate.

## Avoid using "queer"
In older AA literature, "queer" is used with its traditional meaning of "odd or strange." In today's English, "queer" is almost always used either (a) to mean someone who identifies outside of the hetero-normative or cis-gender-normative paradigms or (b) as a slur to refer to someone who is not straight or cis-gendered.

To avoid confusion and also to avoid triggering folks who may have had "queer" used as a pejorative towards them, we opt to replace "queer" with a different descriptive adjective.

### Old
"Show them, from your own experience, how the queer mental condition surrounding that first drink prevents normal functioning of the will power."
### New
"Show them, from your own experience, how the distorted mental condition surrounding that first drink prevents normal functioning of the will power."

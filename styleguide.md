## Gender of God 
Avoid using any pronouns when referencing God.

For any given alcoholic God may be a: he, she, it, they, etc. When we say "God as we understand Him," we are implicitly saying that any concept of God is fine, so long as it's a man. Other remixes have replaced "God as we understood Him" with "our Higher Power as we understood it." While we agree that this is an inclusive remixing of the text, we found it to be too distracting when being read alongside a non-remixed text and found that replacing "Him" with "God" to flow more naturally. Moreover, we had noticed that some members of AA already did this when reading "How It Works" at the beginning of an AA meeting.
### Original
> God as we understood Him 
### Remixed 
> God as we understood God 

## Singular they
Replace gendered pronouns with singular they.

Try to establish singular they by having a clear singular subject antecedent. When there are multiple "they" pronouns in a sentence, make sure that each usage of "they" has its antecedent appear before any other "they" pronouns that refer to different antecedents. Otherwise restate the antecedent.

### Original
> No matter how much one wishes to try, exactly how can he turn his own will and his own life over to the care of whatever God he thinks there is?
### Remixed
> No matter how much one wishes to try, exactly how can they turn their own will and their own life over to the care of whatever God they think there is?
### Original
> They simply will not budge; they make him desperately unhappy and threaten his newfound sobriety.
### Remixed
> Their problems simply will not budge; they make the alcoholic desperately unhappy and threaten their newfound sobriety.

## Using person instead of "man"
Favour using "person" or "people" over "man" or "men"

Also avoid using gendered profession names that end in "man" (e.g. clergyman, businessman.)
### Original
> This brave philosophy, wherein each man plays God, sounds good in the speaking, but it still has to meet the acid test: how well does it actually work?
### Remixed
> This brave philosophy, wherein each person plays God, sounds good in the speaking, but it still has to meet the acid test: how well does it actually work?

## Men and women
Use "people" instead of "men and women."

While these uses are trying to be more inclusive, they still exclude non-binary individuals. Replace "man and woman" with something like "person" and "men and women" with "people" or "everyone."
### Original
Every man and woman who has joined A.A. and intends to stick has, without realizing it, made a beginning on Step Three.
### Remixed
Every person who has joined A.A. and intends to stick has, without realizing it, made a beginning on Step Three.
### Original
No adult man or woman, for example, should be in too much emotional dependence upon a parent.
### Remixed
No adult, for example, should be in too much emotional dependence upon a parent.

## Masculine collective nouns
Avoid words that assume a group of people are all male

For example: brotherhood and mankind
### Original
The sum of all this mighty effort is less peace and less brotherhood than before.
### Remixed
The sum of all this mighty effort is less peace and less kinship than before.

## Gendered caregivers
Use "parent" instead of "mother" or "father."

Often it is assumed that a mother is a stay-at-home caregiver and a father is a breadwinner. Using "parent" instead create the space for people of any gender to assume either of these roles.

## Gendered partners
Use "partner" instead of "wife" or "husband."

Often it is assumed that alcoholics are men married to (non-alcoholic) women. This does not reflect reality. Alcoholics can be any gender and can be in non-marriage partnerships with people of any gender.

## Pronouns when referring to specific people
Keep gendered pronouns if they refer to specific people.

We do not want to erase the gender of specific people when they are identified in the original text.
### Unchanged
> So did a friend of mine who was a one-time vice-president of the American Atheist Society, but he got through with room to spare.”

## Gendered language in quotes
Remix gendered language in quotes using brackets.

Because we assume that the authors of AA literature were not intentionally using exclusionary language, it is safe to remix this language as long as brackets are used around the changes so as to not misrepresent the person being quotes.
### Original
> “THIS is the Step that separates the men from the boys.” So declares a well-loved clergyman who happens to be one of A.A.’s greatest friends.
### Remixed
> “THIS is the Step that separates the [adults] from the [children].” So declares a well-loved clergyperson who happens to be one of A.A.’s greatest friends.

## Fellow and fellowship
Using fellow and fellowship is OK.

While some dictionaries have archaic or obsolete definitions of fellow as masculine. However, ["fellow" itself is etymologically gender neutral]. In a survey of different online discussion boards, most people tend to agree that fellow in most modern usages is gender neutral. Lastly, prior art, [Inclusive Big Book], does not change instances of "fellow" and "fellows". There are some instances in the text here, that we have remixed "fellow" singular into "someone" or "person" when it seemed appropriate.

## Queer
Avoid using the word "queer."

In older AA literature, "queer" is used with its traditional meaning of "odd or strange." In today's English, "queer" is almost always used either (a) to mean someone who identifies outside of the hetero-normative or cis-gender-normative paradigms or (b) as a slur to refer to someone who is not straight or cis-gendered.

To avoid confusion and also to avoid triggering folks who may have had "queer" used as a pejorative towards them, we opt to replace "queer" with a different descriptive adjective.
### Original
> Show them, from your own experience, how the queer mental condition surrounding that first drink prevents normal functioning of the will power.
### Remixed
> Show them, from your own experience, how the distorted mental condition surrounding that first drink prevents normal functioning of the will power.

## Opting for singular they
Replace gendered pronouns with singular they. Try to establish singular they by having a clear singular subject antecedent. When there are multiple "they" pronouns in a sentence, make sure that each usage of "they" has its antecedent appear before any other "they" pronouns that refer to different antecedents. Otherwise restate the antecedent.
